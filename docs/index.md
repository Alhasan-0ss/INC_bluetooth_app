## Welcome to our page

With this app you can locate and find your bluetooth devices using the received signal strength indication (rssi), the closer you get, the stronger the signal will be. DOES NOT WORK WITH HEADSET.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Eszter96/INC_bluetooth_app/edit/webpage/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
